Origin: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
Change: 6a7db34ff63345a7badec79ebea3aaef1712f374
Tag: 1.5.1

This is the contents of src/boards, src/common,
src/rp2040, and src/rp2_common, excluding cmake files.

I suspect we'll trim it back closer to just the
register definitions, but for now leave it mostly
as-is to simplify updating as the pico sdk updates
and we figure out how deeply (or not) to integrate
it with lk.
